    "    y = (x + 1)[::2].sum()  # everything here was delayed\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  Calling the `.compute()` method works well when you have a single output.  When you have multiple outputs you might want to use the `dask.compute` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> x = delayed(np.arange)(10)\n",
